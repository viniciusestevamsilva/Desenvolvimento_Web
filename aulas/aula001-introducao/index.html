    <b> Is Lorem Ipsum?</b>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the <i>industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled</i> it to make a type
        specimen book. <u>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</u> It was popularised in
        the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> passages,
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
        versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
